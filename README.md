# Solenoise
midi to embedded system compressed file format converter

Solenoise was a project I made over the summer of 2016 that could robotically play a piano using an Arduino mega and an array of 60 solenoids.
Part of this project required a song to be stored on imbedded hardware, and to be playable by robot fingers.
